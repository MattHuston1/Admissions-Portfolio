  <h2>My Coding History</h2>
  <p>
    I started learning to code a little over a month ago on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">CodeCademy.</a>
    At first I felt overwelmed and honestly I still feel this way some days but I just keep pushing and it's really starting to click.
    A few weeks ago I had a meeting with a friend (Steve Abrams) who graduated from Galvanize a couple years ago. He really encouraged
    me to choose Galvanize as my only consideration for a Web Development school. He told me that while I may be able to get a similar
    education somewhere else for cheaper, I wouldn't be able to get the same level of support from the staff and opportunities to network
    that Galvanize provides and that is very important ot me.
  </p>
  <h2>Learning HTML and CSS</h2>
  <h3>HTML</h3>
  <p>
    I loved how easy it was to add a title tab and this really encouraged me to know that I can do this.
    I always wondered how to embed a link and now it's so easy to me. Everything seemed to click, until I got to tables.
    Tables opened up new level of diffuculty for me that only continued with css. I created a table later in this webpage
    and had to look up several steps to complete it. It still doesn't look the way I had hoped but it will work for now.
    At first CodeCademy had me doing some of the styleing directing on html. This seemed confusing to me and somewhat limiting
    and also took up a lot of space on my code. Luckily I read further about css and how I can make an entirely separate file
    with just css and just link it to my html file in the head.
  </p>
  <h3>CSS</h3>
  <p>
    CSS felt pretty natural to me at first but the box model and grid took some time to get through. Picking fonts from google was
    confusing while learning on CodeCademy but when James went over it in the second "Learning to Code" class that I went to, it all made
    sense. We picked several different fonts from google to play around with. Making a webpage creative can be difficult using only html.
    I like how css allows you to make the webpage exactly how you want it to look. Obviously I've got some work to do in css to make this
    page look better. Picking a color using a hex code was overwhelming to me at first until I went to class and James show us the Adobe
    color wheel and now I love how many options I have. For this website I only used the names of colors to keep it simple but look
    forward to playing with the color wheel.
  </p>
  <h3>Languages I've completed basic training in CodeCademy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Languages I am currently working on in CodeCademy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Javascript</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Coding Classes I've attended</h3>
  <p>
    I have attended two of the free coding classes at the Galvanize Platte location and two of the "3 week javascript" classes so far.
    The first one focused on "intro to html" and the second focused on "intro to css". I had already gone through these courses
    on CodeCademy but it was a good refresher and there were several things I learned that I didn't learn or atleast register
    on CodeCademy. It was also great to actually talk to someone about the code and problems I had rather than just reading about it.
    I just went through the first two days of the "3 week javascript" course and James is making my learning experience much more
    enjoyable than learning javascript on CodeCademy. Javascript was a lot more difficult for me to learn on my own than html and css
    so I feel this course will better prepare me for the "Web Development Immersive Program".
  </p>
  <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
  <h3>Logic Puzzle</h3>
  <h4>Alien Invasion</h4>
  <p>This puzzle was rather fun for me because I play a lot of sudoku. Both games are basically a process of elimination.
    Right away it tells you that Karen got Wattin and that Jarix has the glow in the dark eyes. After that
    they just saw who doesn't have what. I copied the chart they made on a piece of paper and crossed out the
    options I knew couldn't happen and colored in the options that were a sure thing. As soon as I found a for sure option,
    I would cross out all the others in that row. This quickly narrowed it down to the only possible options.
  </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Alien</th>
          <th>Attribute</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Andrew</td>
          <td>Flubsub</td>
          <td>Bubbles</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Dudley</td>
          <td>Gribbet</td>
          <td>Color</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Georgina</td>
          <td>Jarix</td>
          <td>Eyes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Karen</td>
          <td>Wattin</td>
          <td>Fins</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  <h3>Describe a Process</h3>
  <p>
    Let's say there's a lamp that won't turn on in the living room. The first thing I would do is check to see if it's plugged in.
    If it isn't I would plug it in and try again. If it is I would test the lamp on a different outlet and also test a seperate
    electronic device on both outlets. If the lamp turns on with the other outlet then I know that the problem is the first outlet.
    My current house has GFCI outlets so I would test and reset that outlet first. If the lamp doesn't work on either outlet while
    the other electronic device does work then I know that problem is either the lamp or the bulb. Next step is to replace the bulb.
    If a new bulb doesn't work and we know the outlet is good then it must be the lamp. If I really liked this lamp I would open it
    up and check if any of the wires came loose. If so I would grab my soldering iron and solder it back and then try again. If this
    step fails I believe it is time to throw away the lamp.
  </p>
  <h3>Creative Project</h3>
  <p>
    My number one passion is creating music. I mostly play guitar but I like to mess around on other instruments as well. My roomates
    and I have a jam room/studio in the basement and we play together all the time. I don't have any recent recordings but here is a
    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/matt-huston" target="_blank">link to my soundcloud account.</a> All of these "improv jams" are about
    4 years old and I would like to think we have all progressed tremendously as musicians since then. I don't currently have a good way
    of recording my music unfortunately as I would love to show some of my recent works in progress.

  <p>
    I created this page to be an "all in one" type portfolio. I know its very sloppy but that's what I'm going to school for, right?
    I tried to showcase most of the skills I have learned so far. There were a couple sections that took me longer than I expected and
    sections that I couldn't figure out at all. I coulnd't figure out how to make the box around my main h1 heading with the border smaller
    in width. The table took me forever and its still not the way I want it to look. I still don't know how to publish a website so I hope
    this will be viewable when I send it in. Most of this was done off of memory but obviously I had to look a few things up.
  </p>
  <h4>Here's a few things I had to look up</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Organized List</li>
    <p>I knew how to make a list with bullets(unorganized list), but couldn't remember how to make a list with numbers.</p>
    <li>Turning a picture into a link</li>
    <p>This one I learned in the "Intro to HTML" class and on CodeCademy. After multiple failed attempts to do it on my own I had to google it.</p>
    <li>Directing a link to a new tab</li>
    <p>When trying to figure this one out, all I could remember was "target". It can be irriatating when I click a link of a webpage and it doesn't
    direct me to a new tab.</p>
    <li>Table</li>
    <p>The table I made probably took the longest for me to create.</p>
    <li>Linking the css stylesheet</li>
    <p>I knew how to start it with "link href" but forgot about "rel" and "type".</p>
  </ol>
